# Tasks

- Increase transmitter power for less packet loss.

- Delta Measurement: Synchronization delay measurement.

- Hardware selection: Microphones and Speakers that support ultrasonic range and have USB support so that they can be used easily with Raspberry pi.

- Select Sound detector: Mhmd Hussaini suggested using sound detector to estimate time from transmit signal to sound coming out. Check if these devices are available and have sufficiently low delay to be used for such a measurement.
